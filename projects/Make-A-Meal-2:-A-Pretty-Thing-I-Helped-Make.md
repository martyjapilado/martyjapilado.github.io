<h3>My Experiences in Developing This Project</h3>
When looking at the project, I take into account the amount of UI design I had to do. I started off with having a vague idea of how to design these pages. It started with changing the background constantly early with a color of brown but then ending with a result with a color pallette

<h3>Oh yeah, I really should have done that...</h3>
So there was a piece of advise I received in the process of developing this. It was that it would have really been nice to just code the User Interface bits such as buttons, footers, navbar placement and such, for the reason that we would have something nice to look at and work with beforehand rather than coming up with things on the fly. Let us look at the recipe list for example

What I should have done is lay down a framework on the presentation of the cards, such as figure out how to do something such as the layout so we wouldn't get hung up on it later. I guess what I'm trying to say is make it look organized and pretty before hand.
