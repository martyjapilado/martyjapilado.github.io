This is a Record-Keeping Program that has the following features:
-Number ID designation for each record.
-Record contains name and address.
-Sorts ID's by numerical value
-Can add, delete, print, print, or delete all data in the list. 
-Can make an additional copy of list
-Saves records onto text for for later use so when opened the records in the database remains.

This project was a solo project, where all of the code was written by myself, there was a similiar one I did before this that was written in C but lacked the features of reversing the list.
