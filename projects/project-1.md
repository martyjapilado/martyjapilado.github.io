<p>
The Record-Keeping Program was a program I managed to code in C++ for ICS 212. The features of this program include, number ID designation for each record, with record contains name and address. IDs that were added through the add feature in the program were placed and sorted by numerical value. The user could either add a new record, delete an existing record, reverse the list of records, print a designated record, or print all records in the list. An additional additional copy of the list can be made. Records are also saved onto a text file for later use so when the program is run again, the existing records from the previous record remains.
<p>
This project was a solo project, where all of the code was written by myself, there was a similiar one I did before this that was written in C but lacked the features of reversing the list. What I managed to take away from this project is experience in projects in C and C++ knowledge, also working with UNIX to create and compile this project. I manage to also do most of the debugging of the code on Visual Studios (utilizing C and C++). UI was one of the bigger things focused on here, as I managed to have input be based on string input (Ex. typing "add" adds a record) rather than numerical or integer value input (Ex. pressing 1 and entering adds record).
