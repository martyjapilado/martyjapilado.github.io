<p>
This is a Record-Keeping Program that has the following features: <br />
-Number ID designation for each record.<br />
-Record contains name and address.<br />
-Sorts ID's by numerical value<br />
-Can add, delete, print, print, or delete all data in the list. <br />
-Can make an additional copy of list<br />
-Saves records onto text for for later use so when opened the records in the database remains.<br />
<p><br />
This project was a solo project, where all of the code was written by myself, there was a similiar one I did before this that was written in C but lacked the features of reversing the list. What I managed to take away from this project is experience in projects in C and C++.
