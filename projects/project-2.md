summary: Helped with the aid of my school library, donate books to a school in the Philippines

<p>
This project was my senior project back in high school. The idea was that me and our school's Interact Club would send a bunch of books for children on to a school at San Julian Elementary School at a town at Tabuk. I managed to get help with some faculty back at my school's library to organize a bunch of books to send off, along with our school's Interact Club. We managed to send off a bunch of books that were originally going to be tossed (and most likely burned) but managed to do some convincing and redirect it's destination to and elementary school in the Philippines.

I managed to present my skills in team organization and communicating with organizations to get resources for a project. This was mostly arranging a donation, that being books to the elementary school in the Philippines. It's a bit weird to see this on a TECHfolio, but it's one of those group projects I'm proud of because of the way I managed to pull it off working with the school faculty and the Interact Club at the time. Usual projects like these usually took longer somehow, but for this project to be successful was a huge deal. It somehow ended under the radar locally, but that's alright. There is no link or source of the project other than contact information of my supervisors and the faculty of both my high school (which I choose to keep confidential for now) and the elementary school the books were donated to.
