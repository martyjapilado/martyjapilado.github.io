There are things that I start to notice the more I move up within the Computer Science. There are things in code that we always run into such as bugs, errors, etc. I noticed that coding styles is a given in all courses, each one with their own differences and similarities (getting some déjà vu vibes just typing that). In terms of a design pattern, it gets a bit broader as there are common occurrences, misconviniences, and things that give me heart palpitations within code that I often experience. Some instances of this is can be minor, such as a missing bracket at the end of the code. 

However, there are much broader cases such as a recent case I experienced with my Software Engineering project. Originally, my team and I decided to work with a single schema to represent a singular object: a recipe. Now, in a recipe there are things such as ingredients or the type of diet the recipe is correlated with. It turned out that incorporating these elements turned out to be more complicated than usual. We then decided to use a less complicated (as told to me) using a pattern similiar to that of a composite design pattern, where the team decided to make four different schemas. These schemas were one for ingredients, one for diet types for the recipes, other elements such as the name and serving size, and a final one where we piece all schemas together. It appeared to be easier and organized in this way.

The organization and structure that design patterns are presented is quite eye opening.Structure is good especially with precautions on hand. It appears to be similar to
