JavaScript, as much as I’m willing to admit, was my first attempt at learning programming. During my high school freshman days, programming became one of my interests for a time before I decided to hold it off for another hobby to try out. I remember it being “easy” but not continuing due to lack of motivation and patience, with emphasis on “patience”. I didn’t expect to get into a career at programming at the time, as I was one of those guys that thought I could make video game for the fun of it, but that didn’t work out.

Now I’m back to relearning JavaScript right after learning Java, C and C++. Compared to the other languages, I appreciate how JavaScript doesn’t have to use a semicolon or specify a certain datatype. I found it interesting could still place the semicolons out of habit, and everything just works. I could do less or more, and it won’t matter. There’s comfort in that, as I have less things to worry about.

I know that it’s a running joke that “JavaScript isn’t that great. Why would you ever code in JavaScript” around certain computer science communities, possibly because it isn’t a “strongly typed language”. I don’t know what that means. There isn’t much experience or time with JavaScript to confirm if I love it so far. For me, it takes time to cozy up to something. For instance, C was the craziest thing to me. At the beginning of my C/C++ course, pointers were such a hurdle to get through. I assume that will happen with JavaScript, possibly with Object Oriented programming as it’s different from that of Java or C++.

 The WODS, practice or no practice, have (as of this point) been challenging but leaves that satisfaction when I manage to solve something, rather than defeat and confusion. The practice WODS is a nice way to practice, with good reason to do so. The practice WODS with Branden Ogata (the class’s Teaching Assistant) are difficult. But they do add insight. The most recent practice WOD with Branden made me realize I could consider making more functions to solve a problem, which I should have considered beforehand. But that’s good to know now. Well, here’s hoping that JavaScript isn’t the worst language I would end up learning.
