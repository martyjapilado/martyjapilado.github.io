Ethics, from the software engineering perspective, is providing a honest product of 
quality that functions for the sake of the user and does not end up threatening basic human rights, such as privacy.

A recent debate that was brought up in my Software Engineering class with the question
‘Should I delete my Facebook account’ came up, and we were assigned to two different sides of the debate: 
To delete our Facebook or to keep our Facebook. We were instructed to look at our assigned perspective from an ethical standpoint.

I was somehow assigned to the ‘No don’t delete your Facebook though’ side of the debate. The debate, in summary, was very one-sided onto 
deleting our Facebook as more evidence presented that it would be unethical to keep our Facebook as it would expose the privacy of not only 
our own privacy but others.

Social media sites and the structure of social media are integrated to be common place in our own daily lives. 
However, with something that is so commonplace in our society, there are some controversial uses in terms of the software world in social media.[Facebook somehow managed to endanger the privacy and compromise multiple users data, which is speculated to be a result of possible foreign activities](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html)
