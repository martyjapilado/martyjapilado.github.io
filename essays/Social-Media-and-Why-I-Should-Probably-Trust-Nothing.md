Ethics, from the software engineering perspective, is providing a honest product of quality that functions for the sake of the user and does not end up threatening basic human rights, such as privacy.

A recent debate that was brought up in my Software Engineering class with the question ‘Should I delete my Facebook account’ came up, and we were assigned to two different sides of the debate: To delete our Facebook or to keep our Facebook. We were instructed to look at our assigned perspective from an ethical standpoint.

I was assigned to the ‘No don’t delete your Facebook though’ side of the debate. The debate, in summary, was very one-sided onto deleting our Facebook as more evidence presented that it would be unethical to keep our Facebook as it would expose the privacy of not only our own privacy but others.

Social media sites and the structure of social media are integrated to be common place in our own daily lives. However, with something that is so commonplace in our society, there are some controversial uses in terms of the software world in social media.[Facebook somehow managed to endanger the privacy and compromise multiple users data, which is speculated to be a result of possible foreign activities](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html) [There's also the case where our information is shared with certain advertisers on the basis of our post history and interests, in possibility that we come accross products that meet our own interest.](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update) This practice can be seen as unethical as it is similiar to the case of somehow being recommended products that could possibly end up being faulty, as we are catered (or suckered) into products that look like they appeal to us. This can be similarly in [Bill's](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) case where he resigned after he programmed code that advertised a drug that had side effects such as severe depression. It would seem unethical in most cases to where people would be drawn to false advertisements and false information. From an ethical standpoint, it woud be seen as morally wrong as we are deceiving multiple users into consuming products and  false information that appears to cater to them.

There are other hurtful things social media outlets are also used for and it's the case of the topic of harassment and cyber bullying. This becomes more controversial as we reach the territory as censorship, another unethical practice, comes into play. As it is seen people definitely have the right to express themeselves onto others within these outlet. But the ethical perspective considers that if the speech were to harm somebody, then we as developers of this output have to put a stop to it somehow. That means if speech that could be classified as harmful or hate speech is spoken, we have an obligation to stop it if another user is uncomfortable or worse.

A certain thought came into my mind during this debate. Why is it we use social media in particular? There are multiple reasons for this like the sake of communicating on a free platform, to see how our loved ones are. As for me, I used Facebook for the sole purpose that I could contact my own family members and family friends who I can’t originally contact on phone. But that reasoning is flawed, as I would knowingly put in danger not just my privacy, but my own family’s and friends’ privacy.
